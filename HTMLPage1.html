    <p>Hello, my name is Craig, I live 30 minutes away from RIT(so I am commuting) and I went to Schroeder HS. In my free time I like to play video games,
    <p></p>right now when i'm not doing hw I like to play Rainbow Six siege. During the school year my schedue is pretty boring, Its usually school, homework and hanging out with
    <p>my girlfriend. I like to go camping, we are going on a camping trip the weekend to the week this assinment is due. When i'm not in school I like to hang out with my friends. I played 
    <p></p>hockey from elementry school through HS. Since my recreation years of hockey are over I have recently been getting into golf and I did that a lot this summer with my friends who are also getting
    <p>into golf.
